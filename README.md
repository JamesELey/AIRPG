# Grid Game

A simple grid-based exploration and farming game built with Python and Tkinter.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation
This game uses Python's built-in Tkinter library for the GUI, so no external package installation is usually required.

### Running the Game
1.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory (`runnable_game`).
3.  Run the game using the command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## How to Play

### Objective

## CI/CD and Merge Requirements

This project uses GitLab CI/CD to run automated tests for the save/load functionality. The configuration ensures that all tests must pass before a merge request can be approved.

### Setting Up Protected Branches

To enforce passing tests before allowing merges, follow these steps in GitLab:

1. Go to your GitLab repository
2. Navigate to **Settings > Repository > Protected Branches**
3. Protect your main branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. Under **Allowed to merge**, select **Maintainers** (or your preferred role)
5. Check the **Require status checks to pass before merging** option
6. Save your changes

### Setting Up Merge Request Settings

To enforce CI pipeline success for merge requests:

1. Go to **Settings > Merge requests**
2. Scroll to **Merge checks**
3. Enable **Pipelines must succeed**
4. Optionally, also enable **All discussions must be resolved**
5. Save your changes

### Running Tests Locally

You can run the same tests locally before pushing:

```bash
cd tests
python run_all_tests.py
```

If all tests pass, your changes are ready to be pushed for review!
